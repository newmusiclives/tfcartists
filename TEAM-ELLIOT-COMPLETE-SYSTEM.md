## 🔄 THE ARTIST REFERRAL FLYWHEEL

This is the **#1 growth engine** for Team Elliot:

```
1. Artist's track airs on station
2. River sends instant alert + share pack
3. Artist shares to their fans (Instagram/TikTok/Facebook)
4. Fans listen → some become regular listeners
5. More listeners → sponsor value increases
6. Harper signs more sponsors → artist pool grows
7. Artists earn more → they share more
8. Cycle repeats
```

**Example:**
- Sarah Blake has 5,000 Instagram followers
- Her track airs on TrueFans RADIO
- River sends her: clip + graphic + caption
- Sarah posts it
- 200 of her fans click through
- 35 become regular listeners (3+ sessions/week)
- Those 35 listeners increase sponsor value
- Sarah earns more from artist pool
- Sarah shares again next month

**Conversion Math:**
- 340 artists × 1,000 avg fans = 340,000 potential listeners
- If 10% engage with share = 34,000 impressions
- If 5% convert to listeners = 1,700 new listeners
- If 40% retention = 680 regular listeners

**Result:** Artist referrals can drive 680+ regular listeners per month at scale.
