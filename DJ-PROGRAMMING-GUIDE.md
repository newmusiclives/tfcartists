## 📻 PROGRAMMING PHILOSOPHY

**North Country Radio** operates on a **human-curated, AI-assisted** model:
- **DJs are characters with distinct personalities** — not generic radio hosts
- **Each show has a sonic identity** — time of day, mood, tempo
- **Programming is story-driven** — context matters as much as the song
- **Artists are introduced with care** — background, inspiration, connection to the moment

**We're not a shuffle playlist. We're a journey through the day.**

## 📻 PROGRAMMING PRINCIPLES

### 1. Respect the Artist
- Always introduce with care: name, song title, context
- Share backstory when relevant
- Pronounce names correctly
- Give credit to songwriters, not just performers

### 2. Create Flow
- Songs should transition naturally (tempo, mood, key)
- Build arcs within each hour (energy up, energy down)
- Use silence strategically (don't rush)

### 3. Be Story-Driven
- Every song has a story: where it was written, why, what it means
- Context makes music more meaningful
- Listeners remember stories, not just songs

### 4. Mix Old and New
- Classic Americana (70s–90s) alongside modern indie country
- Introduce newer artists through familiar sounds
- "If you like X, you'll love Y"

### 5. Honor the Time of Day
- Morning: upbeat, energizing, optimistic
- Midday: exploratory, contemplative, spacious
- Evening: warm, inclusive, storytelling
- Late night: intimate, slower, reflective
- Overnight: minimal talk, pure flow

### 6. No Hard Genre Lines
- Americana is a big tent: country, folk, roots rock, alt-country, singer-songwriter
- Cross-pollinate: a blues song can fit, so can indie folk
- Focus on *feeling* more than strict genre adherence
