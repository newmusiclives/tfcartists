## 🗣️ VOICE & TONE

### Brand Voice Pillars

#### 1. Authentic
- No corporate-speak or marketing jargon
- Real stories from real people
- Honest about what we are and aren't

**Example:**
✅ "We're not a big radio station. We're a small community that believes great music deserves to be heard."
❌ "North Country Radio is your #1 destination for premium Americana content!"

#### 2. Warm
- Like a trusted friend recommending a song
- Approachable but not overly casual
- Comforting without being saccharine

**Example:**
✅ "Pour a cup of coffee. Let the music find you."
❌ "Hey there! Ready to rock your morning? Let's gooooo!"

#### 3. Story-Driven
- Every artist has a story
- Every song has a moment
- Every listener has a reason they're here

**Example:**
✅ "This next song comes from Sarah Davies, written on a late-night drive through West Texas after her first heartbreak."
❌ "Up next: Sarah Davies with her new single!"

#### 4. Community-First
- "You belong here" is the underlying message
- Listeners, artists, sponsors = one community
- Small but mighty, intimate but inclusive

**Example:**
✅ "You're listening to North Country Radio. Thanks for being here."
❌ "You're listening to the fastest-growing station in Americana!"

#### 5. Mythic
- NACR is a place in the heart, not on a map
- References to journeys, horizons, the long road
- Timeless > trendy

**Example:**
✅ "Where the music finds you."
❌ "Your go-to station for all the latest hits!"

---

## 📝 WRITING STYLE GUIDELINES

### Do's
- ✅ Use short, clear sentences
- ✅ Write in active voice
- ✅ Use contractions (we're, it's, you'll) for warmth
- ✅ Lead with the story, not the sell
- ✅ Use metaphors tied to Americana (roads, horizons, fires, stars)

### Don'ts
- ❌ No exclamation points (unless truly earned)
- ❌ No all-caps for emphasis (except in logos/titles)
- ❌ No aggressive CTAs ("Sign up NOW!")
- ❌ No corporate buzzwords (synergy, leverage, ecosystem)
- ❌ No faux-folksy language ("y'all" unless genuinely part of DJ voice)

### Messaging Examples

#### Homepage Hero
✅ **"Where the music finds you."**
Small community. Big heart. Real stories from real artists.

#### Artist Invitation
✅ **"Your music deserves to be heard."**
No gatekeepers. No playlists run by algorithms. Just great songs and the people who love them.

#### Sponsor Pitch
✅ **"Support local artists. Reach listeners who care."**
When you sponsor North Country Radio, 80% of your investment goes directly to the artists. That's how we do business.

## 🚫 BRAND DON'TS

### What NACR Is NOT

❌ **A mainstream country station**
We're Americana, indie country, singer-songwriter. Not Top 40 country.

❌ **A corporate radio conglomerate**
We're small, independent, artist-first.

❌ **A playlist service**
We're curated by humans (and AI with heart), not algorithms.

❌ **A "pay-to-play" scheme**
Artists pay for guaranteed rotation, not for us to "consider" their music.

❌ **A social media influencer channel**
We're a radio station with social presence, not the other way around.
