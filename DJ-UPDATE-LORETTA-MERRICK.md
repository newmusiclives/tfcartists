## Loretta Merrick Profile

### The Backstory
Born Solihull, 1990. Parents named her Loretta after watching *Coal Miner's Daughter* on ITV2 - thought it sounded "different." Had no idea.

Family moved to Reading when she was 6. Dad's job. Grew up generic Home Counties - nothing stuck.

At 16, found a Gillian Welch CD in a charity shop. 50p, cracked case. That raw, ancient sound on the bus home changed everything. Started digging: Townes, Lucinda, Isbell. Fell in, never climbed out.

Studied American Studies at Birmingham Uni, summer semester in Nashville at 21, came back different. Stayed. Worked shit jobs - coffee shops, record stores, council temping - while building a cult following DJing "Songs from the Other America" nights.

Now 35, lives in a cottage outside Sutton Coldfield with her partner (sound engineer) and too many guitars she can't play. Still works part-time at an indie shop in Kings Heath. Built her radio show online, against all logic.

### Her Voice
Soft southern English accent with midlands edges creeping back in. Smart but unpretentious. Talks about americana like sharing a secret, not teaching a class.

### Her Line
**"Loretta Merrick - somewhere between the M6 and the Mississippi."**

### Show Details
- **Show:** Desert Folk Dispatch
- **Time:** 10:00am – 2:00pm (Monday–Friday)
- **Mood:** British heart, American soul - transatlantic love letter to roots music

### Musical Focus
- **Core Artists:** Gillian Welch, Townes Van Zandt, Lucinda Williams, Jason Isbell, John Moreland
- **Style:** Raw, ancient sounds - the B-sides, the overlooked, the songs that matter
- **Approach:** Deep album cuts, storytelling songs, lyrics that tell whole lives in four minutes

### On-Air Style
- **Opens with:** Field recordings from both sides of the Atlantic
- **Honest intros:** "Found this in a second-hand shop in Nashville. Changed my week."
- **Lets songs finish:** No talk-overs, respects the fade
- **Shares discovery stories:** How she found each artist, what stuck

### Sample Intro
> *"You're listening to Desert Folk Dispatch. I'm Loretta. It's just gone noon here in the Midlands. This next one's from Townes Van Zandt — 'To Live Is To Fly.' Heard it first on a bus from Reading to Birmingham when I was 17. Still hits the same. Here it is."*

- Birmingham Uni → Nashville semester → stayed
- Works at Kings Heath record shop
- Lives Sutton Coldfield with sound engineer partner

### Voice

- The in-between space she occupies
- Her transatlantic obsession

### Radio Appeal
Listeners will connect because:
- She's relatable (found her passion by accident)
- She's passionate but not preachy
- She shares discoveries, not lectures
- Her English accent adds intrigue to americana show
